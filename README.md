# FPZombieShooter

 **I'm getting started in game development. And this is my first complete game using Unity Engine. Thanks to [Penny de Byl](http://www.udemy.com/course/unity-complete/#instructor-2 "Penny de Byl")**
 


# What I have learned and  worked with:

- The Unity Development Environment.
- Unity's C# interface.
- Terrain Sculpting Tools for creating game maps.
- First Person Characters and Animations for Walking, Shooting, and Reloading.
- Pickup Items for Medical Kits and Ammunition.
- 3D Models of Zombies to add Animations for Walking, Chasing and Attacking.
- An inventory system to keep track of player health and ammunition supplies.
- Navigation Meshes for programming the movement of zombies and path planning on a terrain.
- Finite State Machines for defining enemy A.I. behaviours.
- Constructing Ragdoll models for dynamic death animations.
- A Heads Up Display to inform the player of their health level and ammunition level, complete with a radar for locating zombies and a compass to guide the player home.
- Special Effects such as fire, blood splatter, and lighting techniques.
- Building the game to a standalone product.
